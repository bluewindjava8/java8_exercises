The findInLine(java.lang.String), findWithinHorizon(java.lang.String, int), and skip(java.util.regex.Pattern) methods operate independently of the delimiter pattern. These methods will attempt to match the specified pattern with no regard to delimiters in the input and thus can be used in special circumstances where delimiters are not relevant. These methods may block waiting for more input.
